<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Overview

  <p align="center"> 
    In this project, we build a algorithmic trading program that is able to automatically trade assets in an environment that is highly dynamic. It does this by utilizing computer algorithms that are able to buy and sell at a faster rate than human traders. We augment the already present trading signals by using machine learning algorithms that are able to conform to newly collected data. Programming in Python and machine learning are combined to create an algorithmic trading bot that is able to learn from new data and evolve in response to changing market conditions. Input features of the model are "tuned" and "adjusted" by us in order to locate the parameters that lead to the most profitable trading outcomes.

## To Conduct the Analysis we:
* We Establish a Baseline Performance.
* We Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm.
* We Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier and Create.
* We Create an Evaluation Report.
  
    
## Results

  We tune, and adjust, the modelâ€™s input features to find the parameters that result in the best trading outcomes. We also choose the best by comparing the cumulative products of the strategy returns.

  ### Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model? Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm?.


  ### What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?

    
  ### What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?
