<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Overview

  <p align="center"> 
    In this project, we build a algorithmic trading program that is able to automatically trade assets in an environment that is highly dynamic. It does this by utilizing computer algorithms that are able to buy and sell at a faster rate than human traders. We augment the already present trading signals by using machine learning algorithms that are able to conform to newly collected data. Programming in Python and machine learning are combined to create an algorithmic trading bot that is able to learn from new data and evolve in response to changing market conditions. Input features of the model are "tuned" and "adjusted" by us in order to locate the parameters that lead to the most profitable trading outcomes.

## To Conduct the Analysis we:
* We Establish a Baseline Performance.
* We Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm.
* We Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier and Create.
* We Create an Evaluation Report.
  
    
## Results

  We tune, and adjust, the modelâ€™s input features to find the parameters that result in the best trading outcomes. We also choose the best by comparing the cumulative products of the strategy returns.

## Cumulative Return Plot that Shows the Actual Rreturns vs. the Strategy Returns:

  ### Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model? Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm?. What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the        training window? What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?
  
The graphics in our analysis show that in the cumulative return plot, the actual return and strategy returns do follow a similar trend. This is demonstrated in the cumulative return plot. Between the years 2019 and 2021, the return on the strategy does, in fact, outperform the actual returns in both the "buy" and "sell" conditions. After that, we back-tested the new model to evaluate its performance, and the data shows that the strategy returns outperform actual return from 2019 through mid-2020. However, the strategy returns changes trends to a losing strategy when compared to the actual returns in 2021. When the strategy is reversed, the asset would be put up for sale at a loss while the actuals continued to rise.
